# File*Swiper*

A tiny macOS app that lets you sort out the contents of a folder by swiping files into buckets.


### ‚ú® Features:
- ‚û°Ô∏è Swipe, drag, or throw files into the folder buckets to move them
- üñºÔ∏è File previews for all native macOS file types
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip files by swiping them upwards
- üóëÔ∏è Trash files by swiping them into the trash can
- ü™£ Add up to 8 buckets at once to sort files into
- üî† Sort files by name, size, and last modified date
- üî¨ See file size, type, and last modified date at a glance
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è Move history, undo the last move
- üïµÔ∏è Folder watching, file list updates on OS level file changes
- üîç Double click to preview file at full size


### ü§ì Interesting bits: 

- [`qlmanage`](https://github.com/sidneys/quicklook-thumbnail) used to generate native file previews for macOS
- [`interact.js`](https://github.com/taye/interact.js) used for adding physics and handling drag interactions 
- [`CSS trigonomic functions`](https://web.dev/css-trig-functions/) used for the circular UI layout
