# File*Swiper*

A tiny macOS app that lets you sort out the contents of a folder by swiping files into buckets.


### ✨ Features:
- ➡️ Swipe, drag, or throw files into the folder buckets to move them
- 🖼️ File previews for all native macOS file types
- ⏭️ Skip files by swiping them upwards
- 🗑️ Trash files by swiping them into the trash can
- 🪣 Add up to 8 buckets at once to sort files into
- 🔠 Sort files by name, size, and last modified date
- 🔬 See file size, type, and last modified date at a glance
- ↩️ Move history, undo the last move
- 🕵️ Folder watching, file list updates on OS level file changes
- 🔍 Double click to preview file at full size


### 🤓 Interesting bits: 

- Preview images are generated using the qlmanage command line tool in a child process, allowing all native OSX file types have preview images.
- Interact.js is used to add physics to the main file list, allowing you to throw files into buckets.
- The new trigonomic positioning of the buckets is calculated using the new CSS Math.sin and Math.cos functions.
- Live reloading during development is using webpack --watch and electron-reload.
